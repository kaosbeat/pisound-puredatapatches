# pisound-puredatapatches
pisound-puredatapatches is my humble contribution to the pi-sound ecosystem.


## monomearp
is an adaptaion of the arp-patch to use the monome as a sequencer.
It makles use of the excellent https://github.com/boqs/pd-grid which you need to compile on the pi yourself (easy)
you'll also need serialosc running in the background
watch out for this https://github.com/monome/serialosc/issues/51
